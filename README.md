# Elevator
Elevator coding challenge

To use:
- clone repository
- import pom.xml into IntelliJ or other IDE
- or: run `mvn clean verify`

Possible enhancements:
- expose as a REST API using netty or other web server
- things like parking of elevators, behavior on multi-press (choosing higher floor when going down, for example) can be discussed and refined
